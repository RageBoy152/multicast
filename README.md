# MultiCast - [Download](https://multicast.watch/download)

MultiCast has received a major overhaul.
Along with the application, there is also a [web version of MultiCast](https://multicast.watch).


# How to Use

### The basics
The home page is split into 2 sections - "Feeds", "Outputs"

When you add a feed, using the "+" button on the top of the feed list, it gets added to the feed list.
You can then drag and drop it into an output feed.

The output area has 3 outputs - A, B & C.
Each output can have between 1 and 9 seperate feeds at once.


### App exclusive features

Due to the lack of browser security restrictions, the Multicast app comes with additional features for a better user experience such as volume sliders on feed outputs, audio level vizualisers and run on startup cababilities.


### Context Menu
Each feed has a context menu (three dots) you can click, you can also right click to open this menu.
In the context menu is buttons to edit, delete and copy credits. Credits will be copied in the format:
[ Credit: [Feed name]\(<link_to_youtube_stream>) ]


### Config editing
You're configuration data is saved in the apps local storage. You can view this data using the settings icon on the navigation bar.
You can copy and paste other peoples configs but only manually edit values if you know what you're doing. There is very minimal input validation here.
